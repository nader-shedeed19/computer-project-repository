<h1>Computer Programming Language:</h1>
<p>Programming language: It is a set of commands, set by some rules, which are determined by the programming language, and these commands go
<br>through several phases, unless they are executed on the computer.  Programming languages are divided based on their proximity
<br> to human languages into:
<br> 1- A language close to the human language (a simple language that is easy to understand) and is a high-level language such as Python and Java.
<br> 2- a language close to the machineâ€™s language (difficult to understand) and it is a low-level language.
<br>Sometimes it is divided according to the desired purposes of the language used, for example there are languages designed to work on specific
<br> devices such as a company producing a central processor or a computer, and it provides a manual for it that contains the commands that are
<br>executed on it, and there are also languages that operate within the default such as the Java language.</p>
